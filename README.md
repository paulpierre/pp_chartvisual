built by [http://paulpierre.com](http://paulpierre.com) in 2016

I developed a web front-end that connected to a series of Meta Trader 4 bots as well as all the visualizations with D3.js

I developed the front-end with the usual suspects, CSS3, JS, HTML5 with JQuery and the backend with PHP on AWS. What was interesting was working with another develop on the trading bots themselves. The C# developer would code the strategy and I would code in C# the part that would write to a MySQL database. From there I would visualize the data in D3.js. With the exception of playing in Unity, this was my first deep experience with C#.

Live app and servers no longer maintained.
